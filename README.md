# Groupmuse-2018

This repository contains a sample of the React Native work I did for Groupmuse, a company which connects musicians to perform at classic music house shows.

There are three folders.

Each folder contains:

1.  A mockup of a desired UI screen provided to me by Groupmuse's design team.
2.  A screen component connected to React Navigator
3.  A container component connected to Redux/Groupmuse's backend API
4.  A presentational component that handles the screen's UI.

Technologies: React Native, Redux, styled-components
